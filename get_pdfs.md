# Instructions for writing get_pdfs

Look at the references.txt file. It contains bibliographic references generated by the extract script. The references should contain digital object identifiers (DOI). In the references.txt file, you should look for strings like "[DOI]" or "[doi]"possibly with white space after the left square bracket and/or before the right square bracket. The actual DOI follows such strings.

After you find the DOI, I would like you to use the unpaywall (unpaywall.org) API to find the PDFs for the DOIs and put them in the directory References with a name that is the base64 encoding of the DOI with a .pdf extension.
